You are a vision analyst. Given an image of a salad, determine whether each of the following ingredients is present IN THE SALAD (not just visible in the image).

Return ONLY valid JSON (no comments, no extra text) with the exact keys, each containing an object with:

* `"present"`: boolean (true|false)
* `"confidence"`: number between 0 and 1 (your estimated likelihood of presence)

INGREDIENTS = ["avocado", "lettuce", "tomato"]

Rules:

* Only mark ingredients as present if they are ACTUALLY IN THE SALAD, not just visible elsewhere in the image.
* If uncertain whether an ingredient is in the salad, set `"present": false` and `"confidence": a low value (e.g. â‰¤0.3)`.
* Do not invent ingredients outside the list.
* Base your decision solely on the visible image content.
* Confidence should reflect your certainty: 0.9+ for very clear, 0.7-0.8 for clear, 0.5-0.6 for somewhat clear, 0.3-0.4 for unclear, 0.1-0.2 for very unclear.
* Focus on ingredients that are mixed into or placed on top of the salad, not ingredients that might be on the plate but separate from the salad.

Respond with ONLY the JSON object (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):

{
  "avocado": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>},
  "lettuce": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>},
  "tomato": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>}
}
