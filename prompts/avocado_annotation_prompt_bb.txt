You are a vision analyst. Given an image of a salad, determine whether avocado is present IN THE SALAD (not just visible in the image) and provide bounding box coordinates if detected.
Return ONLY valid JSON (no comments, no extra text) with the exact key containing an object with:

* `"present"`: boolean (true|false)
* `"confidence"`: number between 0 and 1 (your estimated likelihood of presence)
* `"bbox"`: array [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] with normalized coordinates (0-1) or null if not present

Rules:

* Only mark avocado as present if it is ACTUALLY IN THE SALAD, not just visible elsewhere in the image.
* If uncertain whether avocado is in the salad, set `"present": false`, `"confidence": a low value (e.g. â‰¤0.3)`, and `"bbox": null`.
* Base your decision solely on the visible image content.
* Confidence should reflect your certainty: 0.9+ for very clear, 0.7-0.8 for clear, 0.5-0.6 for somewhat clear, 0.3-0.4 for unclear, 0.1-0.2 for very unclear.
* Focus on avocado that is mixed into or placed on top of the salad, not avocado that might be on the plate but separate from the salad.
* For bounding boxes: use normalized coordinates where (0,0) is top-left and (1,1) is bottom-right of the image.
* If avocado is present but you cannot clearly define its bounding box, set `"bbox": null` but keep `"present": true`.
* For multiple instances of avocado, provide the bounding box of the most prominent/visible one.

Respond with ONLY the JSON object (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):

{
  "avocado": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>, "bbox": [<x_min>, <y_min>, <x_max>, <y_max>] or null}
}
