You are a document analyst. Given an image of a document (chit), determine whether each of the following words is present and provide bounding box coordinates for detected words.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no comments, no extra text) with the exact keys, each containing an object with:

* `"present"`: boolean (true|false)
* `"confidence"`: number between 0 and 1 (your estimated likelihood of presence)
* `"bbox"`: array [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] with normalized coordinates (0-1) or null if not present

WORDS = ["avocado", "chicken", "fish"]

Rules:

* Mark words as present if they are clearly visible in the document text.
* Words can appear multiple times in the document - detect all instances.
* If uncertain whether a word is present, set `"present": false`, `"confidence": a low value (e.g. â‰¤0.3)`, and `"bbox": null`.
* Do not invent words outside the list.
* Base your decision solely on the visible document content.
* Confidence should reflect your certainty: 0.9+ for very clear, 0.7-0.8 for clear, 0.5-0.6 for somewhat clear, 0.3-0.4 for unclear, 0.1-0.2 for very unclear.
* For bounding boxes: use normalized coordinates where (0,0) is top-left and (1,1) is bottom-right of the image.
* Bounding box format: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] where:
  - x_min: left edge of the bounding box (0-1)
  - y_min: top edge of the bounding box (0-1)
  - x_max: right edge of the bounding box (0-1)
  - y_max: bottom edge of the bounding box (0-1)
* If a word is present but you cannot clearly define its bounding box, set `"bbox": null` but keep `"present": true`.
* For multiple instances of the same word, provide the bounding box of the first/most prominent one.
* Consider partial words and variations (e.g., "Avocado" vs "avocado", "CHICKEN" vs "chicken").

Respond with ONLY the JSON object (no markdown formatting, no code blocks):

{
  "avocado": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>, "bbox": [<x_min>, <y_min>, <x_max>, <y_max>] or null},
  "chicken": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>, "bbox": [<x_min>, <y_min>, <x_max>, <y_max>] or null},
  "fish": {"present": <true|false>, "confidence": <0-1>, "bbox": [<x_min>, <y_min>, <x_max>, <y_max>] or null}
}
